# Goals

This is a free, open-source guide to installing Python 3 on a new computer: Windows, Mac, Linux, or Docker.

The goal is to have something for beginners that "just works." It is not to overwhelm them with all the various ways to install Python and manage virtual environments.

If you disagree with a recommended approach, please submit an **Issue** and I'm happy to debate the relative pros/cons of each there. I'm open to changing my mind but, again, I don't want this to bloat out into a dictionary of different approaches.

PRs are welcome for areas--like Linux or Chromebook--not currently covered.
